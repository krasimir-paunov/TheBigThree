# 🎮 The Big Three

A community‑driven web application where gamers curate **their personal Top 3 games of all time**, explain *why* they love them, why others should play them, and earn status based on community recognition.

---

## ✨ Core Idea

Every registered user can create **one personal collection** featuring their **Top 3 games of all time**.
Each game entry includes a personal description explaining:

* Why the user fell in love with the game
* Why others should experience it

Other users can explore collections, star the ones they like, and help creators climb the community ranking ladder.

---

## 👥 User Experiences

### 👀 Guest (Unregistered User)

Guests have access to the **Hub** area where they can:

* Browse all public collections
* View collection details and game descriptions
* See collection ratings (stars)
* Sort collections by:

  * Newest added
  * Most starred

> Guests **cannot** create, edit, delete, or star collections.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Registered User

Registered users have all guest capabilities **plus**:

* ⭐ Star other users’ collections

  * Only **1 star per collection**
  * Cannot star their **own** collection
* 📦 Create **their own Top 3 collection**
* ✏️ Edit or delete their own collection
* 👤 Access a **Personal Page** showing:

  * Collections they have starred
  * Status + additional info
* 🏆 Earn **status ranks** based on community stars

---

## 🏅 User Status & Ranking System

User status is determined dynamically based on the **total number of stars** their collection receives.

| Total Stars | Status              |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| **100+**    | Legendary Collector |
| **30+**     | Superstar Collector |
| **10+**     | Popular Collector   |
| **5+**      | Rising Star         |
| **1+**      | Novice Collector    |
| **0**       | Newcomer            |

> Status updates automatically as stars increase, reflecting the creator’s reputation within the community.

To ensure the application is **not empty on first run**, the database includes:

* **2 pre-seeded example collections**:
  
* Each collection demonstrates:

  * Proper game entries
  * Descriptive recommendation text
  * Star-based ranking behavior

This allows examiners and users to immediately explore the Hub without needing to create data manually.
